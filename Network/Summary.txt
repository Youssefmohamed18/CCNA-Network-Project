# 🛠️ CCNA Network Design Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a complete network design and configuration built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of the CCNA training.  
It simulates a real-world business with **two branches** connected together and provides full internal and external communication for all devices.

## 🗺️ Network Topology

The network is divided into **two main branches**:

### 🔹 Main Branch
- Contains **two multilayer switches (MLS)**: one is the primary, and the other is a backup.
- Each MLS is connected to:
  - A **local server**
  - Two **VLANs** (Virtual LANs) for device separation.
- Connected to:
  - **DHCP Server** (external) – provides dynamic IPs to all devices.
  - **Internet Server** – gives all devices access to the outside internet.

### 🔹 Remote Branch
- Has its own **router** connected to:
  - A **multilayer switch** (or two, if redundancy is used).
  - A **local server** with 2 VLANs (same setup as main branch).

### 🔁 Both branches are connected via **routing between the two routers**.

✅ **All devices can:**
- Communicate within their VLANs.
- Ping devices in other VLANs and branches.
- Access the internet.
